# RecipeBox-project
This is a program I produced for the final of a Java course taken during my Masters' courses at SNHU. This program is able to create recipe objects with unique paramaters, be stored in a box (array) of recipe objects, and allows for these objects to be edited through user input based the decisions made on its interface. The fuctions included in making the program include, get and setRecipeInstrctions, addRecipeInstructions, printRecipe, editRecipe, get and setRecipeName, get and setServings, get and setRecipeIngredients, and getTotalRecipeCalories. This demonstrates my understanding and expertise on Java coding, where these skills were gained during my undergraduate studies at DePaul. There I also created programs able of DFS and BFS using weighted trees or 2-3 trees.
